0. Pixel transformations
1. Masked layer (including coupling)
    * Unit tests mask work as expected
2. Build trivial network with alternative masked/coupling layers + loss function
    * Fit a multidimensional Gaussian
    * Fit a 2D spiral (2 pixels)
    * Fit a single small image (2x2, 4x4), see if we can generate it
3. Batch norm/weight norm
    * Test out running average batch norm -- ensure we can fit a standard
      classifier with batchsize=1 (e.g. cifar + resnet)
    * Test out single small image above, but adding in modifications to loss
      function/log determinant
4. Multi-scale architecture
    * Test out single cifar image with smaller multi-scale architecture depth
    * Go deeper with more images
5. Done!
